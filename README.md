# Lost in Time

## A game jam project made in Unity.

This game was made for Lame Jam April 2023 as part of a 3 day game jam during the Easter vacation. Game jam theme: Playing with Time  
All art and programming were created by myself as a solo project, apart from the Parallax scroll script where the citation has been provided in this script directly.

## What is the game about?

You have become lost in a time far away from your own and must figure out how to restore your own timeline, through dialogue-driven puzzles and time travel.

## Where can I play?

The game is available to download for Windows via my [Itch page.](https://waken-games.itch.io/lost-in-time)

## How was it made?

I chose the Unity engine, coding in C# and created art in Blender. I created a Miro board to manage the project which is available to view [here.](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMQb673Q=/?share_link_id=48528454893)

## Can you pull this repo?

Of course, I made it to learn myself and would be really happy if it helped someone else develop their skills too. If you want to download and work in Unity, please go ahead.

## What did I learn?

I gained a really good mix of coding experience, particularly getting really comfortable with working with transforms and components in C# code directly. My ability to handle errors and debug have become more efficient, as well as refactoring the code to promote DRY and maintainability.

## What's next for the project?

There's one interesting thing I noticed when working on the time travel mechanic and jumping between the past and the future environments. It was that I could have put obstacles that blocked the player from progressing in one time, for the player to figure that they need to go to a different time, move position, and then return to that same time to have moved around the obstacle. This particular mechanic could be implemented in a new idea for a game as I will not be continuing development of this project.
